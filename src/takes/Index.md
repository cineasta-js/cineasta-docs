cineastaJS is a code organizational framework making an analogy between the process of structuring a movie and a web application. For us, web applications are way more dinamic than it was some years before, and terms like `page` doesn't express this dinamism.

The cineastaJS framework was built with two things in mind:

- Convention over configuration
- Duplication over wrong abstraction

Initialy, cineastaJS was created for JavaScript and React, but you can easily apply it to any other language. cineastaJS have a CLI tool which brings automation and customization to a React project and makes it easy to use the framework.
