### What?

cineastaJS uses `create-react-app` to generate a React app structure, and then, add some features to make your life esier:
- plugued with `react-router`
- automatic routing
- require/import from relative paths (src)
- possibility to group takes as scenes (with grouped scenes you can have a wrapper component for multiple routes)
- cli commands for creating app and generating specific parts of the app

### How?

cineastaJS is a framework on top of `create-react-app`, so you have to install it too.

```
$ yarn global add create-react-app cineasta-cli
```

and then simply

```
$ cineasta new my-app
$ cd my-app
$ yarn run start
```
